This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of SARS-CoV-2 viruses sampled early in the course of the pandemic, ie before Feb 1, 2020. Site numbering and genome structure uses [Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of 8 &times; 10^-4 subs per site per year.

There are three versions of this analysis, one rooted by Wuhan/Hu-1/2019 corresponding to the base of lineage B viruses, one rooted by Wuhan/WH04/2020 corresponding to the base of lineage A viruses and one rooted by Sichuan/SC-MY-054/2020 corresponding to the midpoint between lineages A and B. These are available as:

 - [Root in lineage A](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-A)
 - [Root in lineage B](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-B)
 - [Root between lineages A and B](https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/ncov/early-outbreak/root-AB)
